gab@gab-pc:~$ ./AboutMe.sh

As a kid, I remember being scared of that black command line that eventually pooped up when I used to click everything on that ridiculously huge pc.

As a teen, I remember using AlterVista to create my first blog about martial arts when the situation has escalated quickly and,  I turned that blog into a malicious website.

Fortunately, Google took it down in 2 days and, no harm was done. 
Why did I do it? 
It seemed a great idea at the time to experiment with new tech stuff!

As a young adult, I'm focusing my energies on studying Decentralized Finance by myself while taking a degree in Computer science at the uni.

I think It's crucial to know Centralized finance and Decentralized Finance to get the best out of the two.

I'm currently learning Javascript and frameworks like Node.js, Express, MongoDB to master Solidity and write my Smart Contracts.

Actually looking for team members
