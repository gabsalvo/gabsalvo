# Gabriele Salvo

**AI Consultant & Certiport-Certified Instructor**  
MSc Artificial Intelligence & Engineering Systems @ TU/e (Healthcare track)  
Eindhoven, NL · EU/remote

I build human-centred AI systems for healthcare and data-driven teams – from first prototype to production-ready tools your team actually uses.

## What I do

**AI consulting and technical teaching for teams who want results, not buzzwords.**

- **AI & ML systems consulting** – scope, design, and deliver models that plug into real workflows  
- **AI tools & dashboards** – FastAPI/Next.js agents, decision dashboards, monitoring and handover  
- **Technical teaching & workshops** – Python, AI/ML, and foundations for non-CS teams

I’m a **Certiport-certified instructor** and a registered independent consultant in the Netherlands:

- **Trade name:** Gabriele Salvo IT Consultancy  
- **Location:** The Lismortel 42-314, Eindhoven (Head office)  
- **Chamber of Commerce (KvK):** **98178059**

> If you’re thinking “we should get someone we trust to own the AI part”, that’s exactly my role.

## Teaching & community

Teaching is a core part of what I do, not an afterthought.

- [**Certiport-certified instructor**] for Python / AI courses (https://www.credly.com/users/gabrielesalvo/badges#credly)
- Experience teaching and mentoring with:
  - **Save the Children**, **CoderDojo Pisa**, **Hack Your Future**, **Volta Institute**, and university-level courses  
- Style: concrete examples, live coding, and a “theory → code → deployment” pipeline so teams can keep building after I leave  
- Comfortable teaching **technical teams**, **non-CS professionals**, and **students** at different levels

If your organisation needs someone who can both **build** systems and **teach** them to others, that’s my sweet spot.
